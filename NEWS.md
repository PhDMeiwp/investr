# NEWS for investr package

### Changes for version 1.4.1

* Better y-axis limits when x-axis is on log scale (e.g., using log = "x"). Fixes issue #27.
* Better default y-axis label when using `plotFit` on a model with transformed response. For example, calling `plotFit(fit)` where `fit <- lm(sqrt(dist) ~ speed, data = cars)` will have a default y-axis label of `"sqrt(y)"`.

### Changes for version 1.4.0

* Multiple predictor variables are allowed for "lm" and "glm" objects.
* All non-base package functions are now imported.
* The generic function predFit is now exported. This function is used by investr 
  to obtain predictions, and hence, inverse predictions. For example, predFit 
  can be used to obtain prediction intervals for nonlinear least-squares fits 
  (i.e., models of class "nls").
* Improved tests and test coverage.
* plotFit gained methods for "rlm" and "lqs" objects from package MASS.

### Changes for version 1.3.0

* invest now accepts objects of class 'glm' (experimental).
* Functions calibrate and invest now return an object of class "invest".
