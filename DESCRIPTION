Description: This package provides functions, data sets, and examples for
        performing statistical calibration, more generally known as inverse
        estimation, with linear and nonlinear regression models. A generic 
        function is also provided for plotting fitted regression models with or 
        without confidence/prediction bands that may be of use to the general 
        user.
